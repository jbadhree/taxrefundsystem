Web:

Create a NextJS based project in badhtaxrefundweb with the following functionality
1. There must be a login screen, which must take in username and password as 'Bruce@taxrefund.com' and password as 'Chang3m3!'. Create a Backend route for `login` and fetch these data from a file for now. I should be able to change the mock file. The backend service should return a Username as "Bruce Scott" 
2. After login there must be a home page with Welcome "{{UserName}}" message, This page must go to backend route to fetch `UserDetails`, which should fetch a list of tax years. Have 2024 and 2023 in that list. In the screen it must if 2025 (current year) is not present in the list, it must show a message to file taxes for current year. On the left pane it must show past years based on response as `links' no need to do anything for those links as of now.

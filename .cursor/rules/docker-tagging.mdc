# Patch Versioning for Docker Images

- Use semantic versioning in the form of `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.
- When preparing a release, and unless a major or minor change is explicitly specified, increment the patch number.
- For example, if the current version is `v1.0.9`, the next version should be `v1.0.10` following any code update or release workflow.
- Avoid `latest` tags, postfixes, or alternative bumping strategies unless directed.


# Building Docker Images 

- When building docker images that will be used in cloud run use `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64` 
- If build_and_push.sh is available try to use it

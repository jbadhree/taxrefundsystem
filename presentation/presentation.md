## System Design: Tax Refund Status Service

### Problem Statement

[Problem Statement](problem_statement.md)

Focus Areas - Efficiency, Reliability, Secure, Highly Available, Usability

### Requirements 

Functional Requirements:
1. User goes to our web, and checks refund status
2. If its refunded, it must say so
3. Else, it should show the predicted date of refund
4. If there are any problems with refund, it should show next steps
5. Data Pipeline for AI Model


Security Requirements
1. Users must be authenticated and authorized
2. All services involved must have an authentication and authorization mechanism 
3. There must be minimal public internet exposure
4. PII must be encrypted at rest and in transit 


Efficiency requirement:
Each service must have low latency (<200ms) even when there is high traffic 
The whole solution must be highly available - 99.99% and zero down time deployments

Reliability Requirements
Info shown to the customers must be accurate / near real time
Our System must be reliable as well - Even if parts of the system fail, rest should work

Observability
1. Alerts when there is an issue
2. Easy to troubleshoot the issues

Testability 
1. Each component must be individually testable
2. Strong integration tests

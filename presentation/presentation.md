## System Design: Tax Refund Status Service

### Problem Statement

[Problem Statement](problem_statement.md)

Focus Areas - Efficiency, Reliability, Secure, Highly Available, Usability

### Requirements 

**Functional Requirements:**
1. User goes to our web, and checks refund status
2. If its refunded, it must say so
3. Else, it should show the predicted date of refund
4. If there are any problems with refund, it should show next steps
5. Data Pipeline for AI Model


**Security Requirements:**
1. Users must be authenticated and authorized
2. All services involved must have an authentication and authorization mechanism 
3. There must be minimal public internet exposure
4. PII must be encrypted at rest and in transit 


**Efficiency requirements:**
1. Each service must have low latency (<200ms) even when there is high traffic 
3. The whole solution must be highly available - 99.99% and zero down time deployments

**Reliability:**
1. Info shown to the customers must be accurate / near real time
2. Our System must be reliable as well - Even if parts of the system fail, rest should work

**Observability:**
1. Alerts when there is an issue
2. Easy to troubleshoot the issues

**Testability:**
1. Each component must be individually testable
2. Strong integration tests

#### Component Integration

**Service Communication Flow:**
1. **Web Frontend** â†’ **Tax File Service** (HTTP REST)
2. **Tax File Service** â†’ **ML Prediction Service** (HTTP REST)
3. **Tax File Service** â†’ **Pub/Sub** (Async messaging)
4. **Batch Processor** â†’ **Pub/Sub** (Async messaging)
5. **Batch Processor** â†’ **Tax File Service** (Pub/Sub events)

**Data Flow:**
1. User submits tax file via Web Frontend
2. Tax File Service stores data and creates refund record
3. ML Service predicts refund timeline
4. Batch Processor checks IRS status periodically
5. Status updates flow back through Pub/Sub to Tax File Service
6. Web Frontend displays updated status to user

**Security & Performance:**
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens (planned)
- **Caching**: Redis for high-frequency queries
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and metrics endpoints
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling Cloud Run services
